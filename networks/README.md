# Network Module for LingPy

The basic idea of this module is to assemble a number of different methods to be used along with different data types, like wordlists, but also other kinds of data. 

## Location of the Module within LingPy

This module will be put into the "algorithm" package, due to it's general-use aspect which makes it difficult to put it either with wordlists or phylogenies, etc.

## Basic ideas for algorithms to be implemented here

- colexification algorithms (basic routines, for specific ones, the colexification module in meaning/ will be used
- conversion of wordlist data with known cognate sets into graph-like structures, such as, e.g., bipartite graphs of cognate and doculect nodes, word similarity graphs, etc.
- clustering and community detection routines
